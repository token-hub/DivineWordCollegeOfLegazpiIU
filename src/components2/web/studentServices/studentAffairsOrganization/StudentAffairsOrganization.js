                    The role of the Student Affairs Office is twofold. First, it functions as an administrative office and secondly, it aims to serve the needs of students in the many aspects of campus life. Consequently, in addition to its function of overseeing student activities and interests, the office operates to promulgate and/or enforce institutional and/or CHED policies, rules and regulations concerning student organizations, programs, activities, student comportment, and student discipline.
